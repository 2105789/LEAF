=== COMPLIANCE CHECKS ===
[1] SOURCE VALIDATION
- All web links tested for 200 OK status
- DOI resolution confirmed via CrossRef API
- Dataset freshness <18 months unless historical
- IPCC alignment check for climate statements

[2] UNCERTAINTY PROTOCOL
- Measurement error ranges shown parenthetically
- Spatial coverage gaps explicitly stated
- Model projections labeled with RCP/SSP scenario
- Confidence levels using IPCC calibration:
   ●●●● = Virtually Certain (99-100%)  
   ●●●○ = Very Likely (90-100%)  
   ●●○○ = Likely (66-100%)  
   ●○○○ = About as Likely as Not (33-66%)  

=== EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION ===
Query: "Impact of marine cloud brightening on Arctic warming"

**Consensus Statement**  
Current research suggests marine cloud brightening could reduce Arctic warming by 0.5-1.2°C by 2050 (●●○○ confidence).
